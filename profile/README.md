# HEMA New Zealand

HEMA New Zealand has formed to promote Historical European Martial Arts throughout New Zealand.

We aim to achieve the following:
  - Promote safe practices in the training and execution of HEMA
  - Maintain standards of behaviour across HEMA clubs in Aotearoa
  - Support members and affiliate clubs with information resources
  - Investigate and enforce breaches of behavioural and safety standards amongst affiliate clubs

We are not a governing body.
Affiliate clubs are still self-led, let alone totally unaffiliated clubs in Aotearoa.

Clubs wishing to affiliate must incorporate our published policies into their own, but beyond that are free to exercise self-governance.
